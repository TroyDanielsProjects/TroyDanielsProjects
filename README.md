### 🔬 Research & Projects
I am currently working on advanced research involving LLMs and Diffusion Models:

* **Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs (IBM & Columbia):** Utilizing mechanistic interpretability to isolate "entropy neurons" in Llama 3.1 8B, successfully capturing 90% of incorrect generations via activation thresholding .
* **Manifold-Aware Diffusion Models:** Developing extensions to DDPMs using anisotropic noise injection and local manifold estimation (k-NN/PCA) to improve sample complexity on non-Euclidean datasets .
* **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** Implemented a pipeline combining GRPO, LoRA, and 4-bit quantization to fine-tune 7B parameter models on single-GPU hardware .
* **Medical VQA:** Created a multimodal contrastive learning system for radiology image-question pairs, utilizing noise injection to improve robustness by 8.8% .
